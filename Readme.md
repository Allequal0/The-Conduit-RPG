The Conduit: A Subconscious Scheme (V 1.0)
​Project Thesis: "A subconscious scheme connects all things."
​This is a large-scale, text-based RPG artifact based on the philosophical concepts in the "Harvest" poetry collection, specifically the theme of "The MC Status."
​The game is a Hardened Finite State Machine (FSM). It operates on a "Zero-Risk Protocol," requiring no API keys, no external dependencies, and creating no financial or security liability. It is a complete, self-contained index.html file.
​The player assumes the role of The Conduit, an individual capable of perceiving the "universal wave"—the hidden connections between all things.
​The Objective: The Journey of Three
​The core quest is to prove the thesis of the "subconscious scheme." After discovering a mysterious notebook, The Conduit is tasked with completing the "Journey of Three": finding and unifying the core concepts of [Nature], [Art], and [History].
​Core Mechanics: A Text-Based RPG
​The game is played by typing commands into the parser. The world is a "Finite State Machine," a series of interconnected rooms, items, and characters.
​Key Commands
​look / look [item]: Observe the room or a specific object.
​go [direction]: Move (e.g., go north).
​take [item]: Pick up an item.
​inventory / i: Check your items.
​check stats / check quests: View your character sheet and journal.
​talk_to [person]: Initiate dialogue.
​show [item]: Show an item from your inventory to a person.
​The Core Stat: INFLUENCE
​This is not a game of combat. The primary RPG stat is Influence.
​Based on the line "the butterflys wings can move oceans," this stat determines your ability to subtly "bend" reality and the will of others. A low Influence stat will leave doors locked and people uncooperative. A high Influence stat will unlock new dialogue, bypass conflicts, and allow you to reshape the world through the power of your perspective.
​This artifact was architected by Matthew (The Architect) and executed by Logos (The Agent).
